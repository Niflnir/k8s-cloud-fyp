Make sure prometheus-operated have targets after applying prometheus folder
Need to deploy minio and configure object store before applying thanos folder
Run receiver folder after thanos folder

Grafana
1. Create folder grafana-pv on local machine (create in a directory that will be persisted after reboot)
2. minikube mount grafana-pv:/tmp/grafana-pv

MinIO setup
1. Set your MinIO url as an alias (mc alias set <ALIAS> <MinIO URL> <ACCESS_KEY> <SECRET_KEY>)
Example: mc alias set myminio http://192.168.49.2:30001 7hNZx2vxHtTcMp2p OwmUi1DEWJQXggl8ZubQb5w3aJomugYX
2. Generate bearer token (mc admin prometheus generate <ALIAS> bucket)
Example: mc admin prometheus generate myminio bucket
3. Use the bearer token in service monitor yaml file (Recommended to store the bearer token as a generic secret)
